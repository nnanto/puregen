# Using the Generated Code

The generated code can be used in three different ways:

1. **As Models Only** - Simple data structures with validation and serialization
2. **As Server Implementation** - Service implementations with HTTP endpoints
3. **As Client with Custom Transport** - Client libraries with pluggable transport

## Language-Specific Examples

### As Models Only

- **[Go Models Example](golang/models-example.md)** - Creating and working with generated Go structs
- **[Java Models Example](java/models-example.md)** - Using generated Java classes with builder pattern  
- **[Python Models Example](python/models-example.md)** - Working with generated Python dataclasses

### As Server Implementation

- **[Go Server Example](golang/server-example.md)** - HTTP server implementation with generated service interface
- **[Java Server Example](java/server-example.md)** - Java HTTP server using generated service classes
- **[Python Server Example](python/server-example.md)** - Flask-based server with generated service interface

### As Client with Custom Transport

- **[Go Client Example](golang/client-example.md)** - HTTP client with custom transport implementation
- **[Java Client Example](java/client-example.md)** - Java HTTP client with transport abstraction
- **[Python Client Example](python/client-example.md)** - Python client with requests-based transport
